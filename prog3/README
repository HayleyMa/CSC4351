Poject 3 for Jonathan Hooper and Franshetta Hibbler

It type checks pretty well, but does have some problems with nested scopes in declaration lists that we couldn't figure out.

We moved the trans* methods from the Semant class into their own classes which are subclass of the class Trans.

- Trans: is an abstract class that implements basic helper methods and other that are the same across its subclasses
- TransExp: Translates Expressions with the transExp(Exp) method
- TransDec: Translates Declarations with the transDec(Dec) method
- TransVar: Translate Variables with the transVar(Var) method
- TransTy: Translates Types with the transTy(Ty) mgit ethod
